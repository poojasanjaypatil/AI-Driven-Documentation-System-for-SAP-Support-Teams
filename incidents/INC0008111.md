## Root Cause

## Solution Steps

That new dump you posted (HTTP_COMMUNICATION_FAILURE from CL_HTTP_CLIENT) means your SAP app server still can’t reach the internet over HTTPS (GitHub in this case). That’s a BASIS/network/TLS/proxy issue, not a code bug. Because you don’t have STRUST/SM59 access, run the AI pipeline entirely inside GitHub (no SAP calls needed) and you’ll still get the Markdown in incidents/.

## Notes

- Enhanced by Llama-3 via GitHub Actions (no direct Groq calls from SAP).
