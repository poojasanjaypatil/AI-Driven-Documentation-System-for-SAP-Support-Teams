## Solution Steps

The proposed solution integrates SAP GUI with the ServiceNow API to automatically fetch incident details at the time of resolution, prompting the user within the SAP workflow to provide key solution notes. These inputs, along with the retrieved metadata, are processed by an AI model to generate clear and standardised documentation in Markdown format. The finalised record is stored in a structured GitHub repository with version control, ensuring organised knowledge retention. An AI-powered search interface then allows support staff to quickly retrieve and reuse past solutions, improving efficiency and reducing repetitive troubleshooting
