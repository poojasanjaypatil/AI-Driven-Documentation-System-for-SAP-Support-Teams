## Root Cause

## Solution Steps

This issue usually occurs when the Fiori app cannot retrieve data from the backend OData service due to missing authorizations, incorrect service bindings, or data model errors. First, check in the browser console or network tab if the OData call for the dropdown entity set is being triggered and returning data. If it shows an error (like 403, 404, or 500), verify the service is activated in /IWFND/MAINT_SERVICE and the user has the necessary roles. Also ensure the value help or dropdown entity is correctly mapped in the annotation or JSON model. Finally, clear the Fiori cache (/UI2/INVALIDATE_CLIENT_CACHES) and test again — in most cases, this resolves dropdown loading issues.
