## Root Cause

The dropdown’s items are bound to an OData value-help entity, but the UI5 view sends the request with a missing/empty filter parameter (e.g., Plant), because the model property used in the binding (selectedPlant) is not initialized before the dropdown loads. The backend service expects a non-empty filter and therefore returns HTTP 200 with an empty result set, so no values appear even though there’s no visible error. Client cache then keeps the empty state.

## Solution Steps

In Chrome DevTools ? Network, verify the OData call (e.g., /Z_APP_SRV/VH_Plant?$filter=Plant eq '') returns 200 with an empty array.
