## Issue

- [2026-01-21 06:40:50] admin: I am trying to create a Purchase Order, but SAP shows an error saying the vendor is blocked. I cannot proceed further. Please help.

---

## Root Cause

The vendor master record was blocked for purchasing in SAP. Because of this block, the system does not allow any new Purchase Orders to be created for the vendor.

---

## Solution Steps

The issue was resolved by checking the vendor master record in SAP and identifying that the vendor was blocked for purchasing. After confirming with the business that purchasing should be allowed, the purchasing block was removed from the vendor master data. The changes were saved, and the user was asked to retry creating the Purchase Order. The Purchase Order was then created successfully without any further errors, confirming that the issue was resolved.
