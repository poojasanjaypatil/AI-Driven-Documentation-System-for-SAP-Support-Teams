## Issue

- [2026-01-21 07:26:36] admin: User is unable to execute an SAP transaction.

When attempting to access the transaction, the system displays an authorization error and stops further processing.

User reports that the transaction was accessible earlier but is no longer available.

Business activity is impacted due to missing system access

---

## Root Cause

The user was unable to access the SAP transaction due to a missing authorization object in their assigned role, which caused an authorization error.

---

## Solution Steps

The issue was resolved by first identifying the SAP transaction reported in the incident and reviewing the user's assigned roles. The required authorization object was found to be missing from the role, which caused the access error. After confirming the business requirement, the role was updated to include the necessary authorization and regenerated. Where applicable, the updated role was transported to the relevant system and reassigned to the user. The user was then asked to log off and log on again, after which access to the transaction was restored successfully and the issue was confirmed as resolved.
