## Issue

- [2025-12-08 05:16:57] admin: Taking a really long time to send emails. Last email took almost a minute for sending to complete and there wasn't even an attachment.

---

## Root Cause

The long email-sending time was caused by a slowdown in the mail server, where queued messages and delayed SMTP handshakes increased processing time. Even without attachments, the client waited for the server’s response, resulting in nearly a minute delay.

---

## Solution Steps

The issue was resolved by clearing the mail queue, restarting the mail service, and verifying SMTP connectivity and response times. After the restart, the server processed outgoing emails normally and delays no longer occurred.
