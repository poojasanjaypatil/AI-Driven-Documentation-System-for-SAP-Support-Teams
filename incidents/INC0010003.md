## Issue

- [2025-10-13 00:53:34] admin: RFC call from SuccessFactors integration is only retrieving partial data for some employee groups. Suspected filtering logic issue in ABAP SELECT statement. Need ABAP developer to review and adjust the query.

---

## Root Cause

The incomplete employee records returned by the RFC ZHR_GET_EMP_DATA are likely due to an issue in the filtering logic of the ABAP SELECT statement. This could involve the incorrect configuration of employee groups and subgroups.

---

## Solution Steps

The selection logic was correct by expending the allowed employee group and subgroups, fixing the AND OR conditions and replaceing the hardcode validity check with proper date range filter. The query filter was moved into configuration like TVARVC or custom table and the RFC is retested using SE37 and also SuccessFactors integration to confirm all relevent employee are now returned.
