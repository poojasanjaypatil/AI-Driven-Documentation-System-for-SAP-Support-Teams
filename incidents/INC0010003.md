## Issue

- [2025-10-13 00:53:34] admin: RFC call from SuccessFactors integration is only retrieving partial data for some employee groups. Suspected filtering logic issue in ABAP SELECT statement. Need ABAP developer to review and adjust the query.

---

## Root Cause

The custom RFC ZHR_GET_EMP_DATA, used by the SAP–SuccessFactors integration, is returning incomplete employee records. The issue occurs for specific employee groups and subgroups, where expected personnel data (such as organizational assignment and employment details) is missing from the RFC output.

---

## Solution Steps

The selection logic was correct by expending the allowed employee group and subgroups, fixing the AND OR conditions and replaceing the hardcode validity check with proper date range filter. The query filter was moved into configuration like TVARVC or custom table and the RFC is retested using SE37 and also SuccessFactors integration to confirm all relevent employee are now returned.
