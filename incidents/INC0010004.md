## Issue

## Root Cause

The background job ZFI_AUTO_CLEARING was terminated due to a short dump (ABAP runtime error: MESSAGE_TYPE_X) triggered in program ZFI_CLEARING_PROCESS.The error occurred because of missing configuration in the clearing account determination (table T030). When the program attempted to post a clearing entry, it could not find a valid GL account for company code 1000, leading to the job cancellation.

## Solution Steps

1.Alyzed the short dump in transaction ST22 and identified the missing account configuration.2.Verified job log in SM37 and related spool in SP01.3.Updated clearing account configuration in OBYC for transaction key KDF under company code 1000.4.Performed a successful test run of program ZFI_CLEARING_PROCESS in foreground to confirm proper postings.5.Rescheduled the background job ZFI_AUTO_CLEARING in SM36, which completed successfully without errors.  Add configuration validation logic in the Z-program to check for missing account entries before posting. Implement job monitoring alert in CCMS to notify functional team upon early termination.
